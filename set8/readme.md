TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

I went into the quiz with the mindset that I will NOT use Chat GPT, because to me that is disingenuous, and I am an honest person, I don't cheat.
Getting to the 50% of the quiz was pretty simple, but after it became a lot more difficult.
I shockingly learned a lot in this quiz, and overall it wasn't too bad.
