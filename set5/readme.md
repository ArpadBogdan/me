TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

This week we have talked about Input and Output. What we have done is we requested/ read data from a specified location, weather it's just another locally stored file or something from a website and we have manipulated that data to get some sort of a meaning out of it.

We also learned about JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), of which I have heard in the past, I believe that's how your Instagram Data was/ is structured? Back in the day Instagram only allowed you to download it in JSON, now they allow a more user friendly HTML version.
