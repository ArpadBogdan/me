TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

I have learned quite a lot about the syntax and wording in Python, I'm surprised to see how fast I caught up to a normal working speed. I have used JavaScript in Highschool so I am familiar with the fundamental basics of coding and python is pretty logical to code in for the most part.

I will be honest with you for exercise 3, loop 3 I was on the right path and I was being very chess player about it (as in logical), but it kept returning an absurd amount of values, something like over 100 characters in the list or something stupid like that. THEN I finally gave up and went to the website of the class and saw a debugging video covering that and I did EVERYTHING RIGHT but only one thing I did differently, which was that I defined the number list outside out the loop instead of inside the loop, so I changed it and it worked??? I'm not sure I completely understand why that's the case... 

Also for the final exercise, loop 7, I did get it to construct a pyramid, but I do admit it's not the most high level coding, but it gets the job done, I can't think of a different way of doing it yet...
